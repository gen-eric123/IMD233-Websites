<blockquote cite="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/285834">In summer 1861 Mathew B. Brady began releasing oversize photographs on paper mounts with the series title "Brady’s Incidents of the War." These albumen silver prints with letterpress titles and series numbers were relatively expensive and conceived to appeal to a small but wealthy audience. They constitute the first intentionally produced collectible series of large-format photographs in American photography.<br><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/285834">The Met Museum</a></span><br></blockquote>
<p><strong>Description of The Image from <em>National Archives</em>.</strong></p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.archives.gov/research/military/civil-war/photos">The War Between the States was the first large and prolonged conflict recorded by photography. During the war, dozens of photographers, both as private individuals and as employees of the Confederate and Union Governments, photographed civilians and civilian activities; military personnel, equipment, and activities; and the locations and aftermaths of battles. Because wet-plate collodion negatives required from 5 to 20 seconds exposure, there are no action photographs of the war.<div>The name Mathew B. Brady is almost a synonym for Civil War photography. Although Brady himself actually may have taken only a few photographs of the war, he employed many of the other well-known photographers before and during the war….<br><span style="color:blue">https://www.archives.gov/research/military/civil-war/photos</span><br></div></blockquote>

<h3>Analyse</h3>
<p>I chose this picture because I think the environment after a conflict can give viewers more room to imagine how intense the conflict is. This is a picture taken by Mathew B. Brady in a battle area, Virginia, during the American Civil War. There were 23 states in the North before the war, and there were just 7 states in the South; but, four state in the North, including Virginia, joined the South after the war begins. In military terms, the two sides of the Civil War are not equal in strength. Although there are more states in the north than in the south, the army in the south has just experienced the American-Mexican War, and its strength is relatively strong; in contrast, there is almost no combat readiness in the north. After the war, although the north won, but paid a higher price—a large number of casualties. (I am not good on American history, if I said anything wrong, please correcting my mistakes). At such a time of chaos, Brady took only his photographic equipment to the battlefield with the soldiers. According to the textbook, <q>‘Brady's Photographic Corps’… has been a feature as distinct and omnipresent… have threaded the weary stadia of every march; have hung on the skirts of every battle scene…</q> The picture shows the tragedy of the fighting: many trees collapsed and stone bridge destroyed by fighting. A line could be seen on the middle of the river, dividing the river in half, and the part of the bridge that hung above the river was now completely sunk into the water. The river looks not very deep, because the fragments of fallen trees and parts of stone bridge will sink completely into the water, rather than seeing some of the debris exposed to the water as it is now. Also, this photo should have been taken after the batter, because I did not see the dead bodies in it (people would clean up the battlefield to avoid diseases such as plague after the battle).</p>

<h1> Genji Shimada </h1>
<hr>
<h2> A Look Into Overwatch's Premier Cyborg Ninja </h2>
<img src= "https://static.playoverwatch.com/media/thumbnail/genji-gameplay.jpg" alt="Genji Shimada"></img>
<em><p>(Art from official Blizzard website) </em></p>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p> Genji was once considered the playboy heir of an esteemed criminal empire run by the Shimadas, however when he rejected this lifestyle, his brother, newly appointed leader of the clan, was forced to kill him. Bereft, his brother left the clan only to find he had failed to kill him and Genji had joined an organization by the name of Overwatch in exchange for Genji's help dismantling the rest of the Shimada Clan. After an intense confrontation seen in the Overwatch short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ"><Strong><em>"Dragons"</em></strong></a>, Genji forgives his brother and leaves with the words "Find value in humility, then you will find peace." Leaving his brother to find his own path, Genji was deployed by Overwatch on many missions and through the years Genji became increasingly at odds with himself and disgusted by his own cybernetically enhanced body which led to him traveling the world, eventually finding the Omnic monk Zenyatta who became his mentor and helped him reconcile the two sides of him as one being. </p>

<h3> Playstyle </h3>
<p> In the game <em><strong> Overwatch</strong></em>, Genji is a playable hero in the <strong>Damage</strong> category. His quick movement in succession with a high overall potential DPS(Damage Per Second) he is a very popular choice among the playerbase. His playstyle can vary from close ranged melee players dashing in and rapidly firing his spreadshot at a close range to secure kills to more reserved play featuring poking from a distance to farm up his Ultimate Ability <Strong><span style="color:blue"> Dragonblade</span></Strong>. His powerful ultimate can then be easily paired with a <Strong><span style="color:blue">Nanoboost</span></Strong> from Ana or <Strong><span style="color:red"> Damage Amplify</span></Strong> by Mercy to secure quick kills. In a tight spot Genji has access to a mid-air double jump as well as the ability to climb walls. He also has two abilities, <Strong><span style="color:red">Swift Strike</span></strong> which allows him to dash 15 meters in any direction dealing 50 damage to any enemies he hits and resetting upon enemy elimination. And also <Strong><span style="color:red"> Deflect </span></strong> which allows him to reflect incoming projectiles including bullets for 2 seconds. His Ultimate <Strong><span style="color:blue">Dragonblade</span></strong> resets his <Strong><span style="color:red"> Swift Strike </span></strong> cooldown and causes him to pull out his normally sheathed sword. For each swing he takes, it does 120 damage and lasts for 6 seconds. It's a common strategy to dash above the enemy and use your <Strong><span style="color:blue">Dragonblade</span></strong> to then slash and dash into enemies dealing massive damage and likely securing a couple of kills. </p>
