<h3> Background </h3>
<p> Genji was once considered the playboy heir of an esteemed criminal empire run by the Shimadas, however when he rejected this lifestyle, his brother, newly appointed leader of the clan, was forced to kill him. Bereft, his brother left the clan only to find he had failed to kill him and Genji had joined an organization by the name of Overwatch in exchange for Genji's help dismantling the rest of the Shimada Clan. After an intense confrontation seen in the Overwatch short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ"><Strong><em>"Dragons"</em></strong></a>, Genji forgives his brother and leaves with the words "Find value in humility, then you will find peace." Leaving his brother to find his own path, Genji was deployed by Overwatch on many missions and through the years Genji became increasingly at odds with himself and disgusted by his own cybernetically enhanced body which led to him traveling the world, eventually finding the Omnic monk Zenyatta who became his mentor and helped him reconcile the two sides of him as one being. </p>

<h3> Playstyle </h3>
<p> In the game <em><strong> Overwatch</strong></em>, Genji is a playable hero in the <strong>Damage</strong> category. His quick movement in succession with a high overall potential DPS(Damage Per Second) he is a very popular choice among the playerbase. His playstyle can vary from close ranged melee players dashing in and rapidly firing his spreadshot at a close range to secure kills to more reserved play featuring poking from a distance to farm up his Ultimate Ability <Strong><span style="color:blue"> Dragonblade</span></Strong>. His powerful ultimate can then be easily paired with a <Strong><span style="color:blue">Nanoboost</span></Strong> from Ana or <Strong><span style="color:red"> Damage Amplify</span></Strong> by Mercy to secure quick kills. In a tight spot Genji has access to a mid-air double jump as well as the ability to climb walls. He also has two abilities, <Strong><span style="color:red">Swift Strike</span></strong> which allows him to dash 15 meters in any direction dealing 50 damage to any enemies he hits and resetting upon enemy elimination. And also <Strong><span style="color:red"> Deflect </span></strong> which allows him to reflect incoming projectiles including bullets for 2 seconds. His Ultimate <Strong><span style="color:blue">Dragonblade</span></strong> resets his <Strong><span style="color:red"> Swift Strike </span></strong> cooldown and causes him to pull out his normally sheathed sword. For each swing he takes, it does 120 damage and lasts for 6 seconds. It's a common strategy to dash above the enemy and use your <Strong><span style="color:blue">Dragonblade</span></strong> to then slash and dash into enemies dealing massive damage and likely securing a couple of kills. </p>
