    <p style=font-size:+2>Abraham Lincoln was the famous 16th president of the United States from March 4th, 1861 to April 14th, 1865.
      <br>He was born in Kentucky on February 12th, 1809 to parents Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln.<br>
      <br> He is on the penny and on the $5 bill and all in all - he's a pretty cool guy.<br> </p>
      <br> Some cool things about good ol' Lincoln:<br>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li> He taught himself to read </li>
        <li> Calling him <em>"Babe Abe"</em> has a nice ring to it </li> 
        <li> <strong> LITERALLY </strong> ended slavery</li>
        <!--even though it wasn't really for good reasons (whoops did I say that)-->
        <li> Is an actual god among mankind </li>
          <li> WAS 6'4"!!!!! (holy moly NBA who????) </li>
        <li> Had an actual dream that he was gonna die the day he got dead </li>
    </ul>
  <p> Okay that last one was a bit morbid but dang be careful if you have a dream you gon die cause that might just happen
    <br> (We should call him <em> "All Seeing Baby Abey"</em>)<br>
